An Auto Clicker in python. Inside the code you will see the the variable "delay" (LINE 9) which will be used to change the speed of the CPS. You can increase the number which will make the clicks take longer or decrease the time which will make the clicks faster

"delay = .08 #is 11.8cps"
delay = .7 #is 13cps"

When the program is running the key 'x' will run the autoclicker. As long as your left click mouse button is held down you will be clicking on the setting you have set up. you can hit 'x' one more time to toggle the autoclicker.
When the program is running the key 'b' will terminate the program. Once you terminate the program you will need to relaunch the program to rerun it.
